# Hi 🖖! 
I'm Simone and I'm thrilled to have you here on my personal website. I'm not great at writing bios, but I'll give it a shot! 😄 I'm an AI Engineer with a passion for research and software design. When I'm not immersed in writing ~~spaghetti~~ code or reading the newest Python PePs, you can find me playing guitar or reading books to keep the creative juices flowing.
